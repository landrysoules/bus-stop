# bus-stop

Here is the brand new version of [bus stop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rs.spaceinvade.busstop). It is a complete rewrite in javascript (ionic framework) instead of the previously native android app.  
It is meant to display real time info for buses in Paris and suburb.  
This app is powered by:

- [bus stop server](https://github.com/landrysoules/bus-stop-server)
- [bus stop service](https://github.com/landrysoules/bus-stop-service)
